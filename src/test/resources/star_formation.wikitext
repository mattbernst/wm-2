'''Star formation''' means the earliest stages in a star's life. Dense regions of particles exist in [[molecular cloud]]s known as "stellar nurseries". The clouds collapse under [[gravitation]] into spheres of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] to form [[star]]s.

High density regions of the [[interstellar medium]] (ISM) form clouds, or ''[[nebula|nebulae]]'', where star formation takes place.<ref name=prialnik>{{cite book| last=Prialnik, Dina 2000. | title=An introduction to the theory of stellar structure and evolution| pages=195–212 |  publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=0-521-65065-8| no-pp=true }}</ref>

=== Dense nebulae ===
In the dense nebulae where stars are produced, much of the hydrogen is in the molecular (H<sub>2</sub>) form, so these nebulae are called [[molecular cloud]]s.<ref name=prialnik /> The largest such formations, giant molecular clouds, have densities of 100 particles per cm<sup>3</sup>, diameters of {{convert|100|ly|km|lk=on}}, and masses up to 6&nbsp;million [[solar mass]]es,<ref>Williams J.P; Blitz L. & McKee C F. 2000.

A more compact site of star formation is the opaque clouds of dense gas and dust known as [[Bok globule]]s; so named after the astronomer Bart Bok.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Khanzadyan T. et al. 2002.

=== Spiral galaxies ===
A [[spiral galaxy]] like the [[Milky Way]] contains [[star]]s, the remains of stars (stellar remnants) and a diffuse [[interstellar medium]] (ISM) of gas and dust. The interstellar medium consists of 10<sup>–4</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> particles per cm<sup>3</sup> usually of about 70% [[hydrogen]] by mass, with most of the remaining gas consisting of [[helium]]. This medium is chemically enriched by trace amounts of heavier elements that were ejected from stars as they passed beyond the end of their [[main sequence]] lifetime.

=== Elliptical galaxies ===
In contrast to spirals, an [[elliptical galaxy]] loses the cold component of its interstellar medium within about a [[billion]] years. This hinders the galaxy from forming diffuse nebulae except through  mergers with other galaxies.<ref>Dupraz C. & Casoli F. 1990. The fate of the molecular gas from mergers to ellipticals.

== W75N(B)-VLA2 ==
This is a massive [[protostar]] about 300 times brighter than our [[Sun]]. Astronomers have caught a key stage in the birth of a very heavy star. They used two [[radio telescope]] views of the process 18 years apart. The young star is 4,200 [[light-years]] from Earth and is surrounded by a doughnut-shaped cloud of dust.

The first observation was in 1996. By 2015 its [[stellar wind]] changed from a compact [[spherical]] form to a larger, [[ionization|ionized]]  [[ellipse|elliptical]] shape. This gave information about what happens as a massive star forms.<ref>Carrasco-Gonzalez C. ''et al'' 2015. Observing the onset of outflow collimation in a massive protostar. ''Science'' '''348''' (6230) p114.
