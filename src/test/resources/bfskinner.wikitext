[[File:B.F. Skinner at Harvard circa 1950 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright]] '''[[B. F. Skinner|Burrhus Frederic''' ('''B. F.''') '''Skinner]]''' (March 20, 1904 – August 18, 1990) was an American [[psychologist]], [[behaviorist]], author, inventor, and [[Social philosophy|social philosopher]]. He was the Edgar Pierce Professor of Psychology at [[Harvard University]] from 1958 until his retirement in 1974.

Skinner invented the [[operant conditioning chamber]], also known as the Skinner Box. He was a firm believer of the idea that human free will was actually an illusion and any human action was the result of the consequences of that same action. If the consequences were bad, there was a high chance that the action would not be repeated; however if the consequences were good, the actions that led to it would be reinforced. He called this the principle of reinforcement. 

He innovated his own philosophy of science called [[radical behaviorism]], and founded his own school of experimental research psychology—the [[experimental analysis of behavior]], coining the term [[operant conditioning]]. His analysis of human behavior culminated in his work ''[[Verbal Behavior]]'', as well as his philosophical manifesto ''[[Walden Two]]''. Contemporary academia considers Skinner a pioneer of modern behaviorism along with [[John B. Watson]] and [[Ivan Pavlov]]. [[B. F. Skinner|'''(Full article...)''']] [[Category:Psychology portal]]
